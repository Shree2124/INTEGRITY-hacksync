# 🛡️ Project INTEGRITY  
**AI-Powered Infrastructure Transparency Platform**

> Bridging the gap between government records and on-ground reality using Agentic AI and Geospatial Intelligence.

---

## 🚨 Problem  

Across cities, citizens face a common frustration:  
- Roads break weeks after being “repaired”  
- Infrastructure exists on paper but not in reality  
- Public money is spent, but verification is impossible  

While public spending data exists, it is locked inside complex documents that ordinary citizens cannot easily understand or verify.

**Project INTEGRITY** solves this by creating a **transparent, AI-powered verification layer** between **official public records** and **citizen-reported reality**.

---

## 🧠 What We Built  

INTEGRITY is a **web-based civic intelligence platform** that allows:

- Citizens to upload real-world infrastructure evidence  
- AI to analyze government spending documents  
- Autonomous agents to audit discrepancies  
- A live map to visualize corruption and compliance  

All in real time.

---

## 🧬 How It Works  

### 1️⃣ Evidence Collection  
Users upload:
- Infrastructure photos  
- Automatic GPS location  
- Timestamped proof  

This creates verifiable on-ground evidence.

---

### 2️⃣ Government Data Extraction  
Government project PDFs are processed using AI to extract:
- Project name  
- Budget  
- Contractor  
- Completion status  

This creates a structured **official record**.

---

### 3️⃣ Agentic Audit System  

Three autonomous AI agents collaborate:

| Agent | Role |
|------|------|
| **Retriever Agent** | Fetches official government project data |
| **Audit Agent** | Compares user evidence with official records |
| **Verdict Agent** | Calculates risk score and generates reasoning |

This ensures **transparent, explainable AI auditing** instead of black-box decisions.

---

### 4️⃣ Geospatial Corruption Map  

Every report is plotted on a live map:

- 🟢 Green = Verified & compliant  
- 🔴 Red = High discrepancy / possible misuse  

Users can filter by:
- Roads  
- Sanitation  
- Public Works  

This allows citizens and authorities to instantly identify risk zones.

## 🧪 Example Flow  

1. Government record says:  
   *“Road repaired for ₹5,00,000”*  

2. Citizen uploads a photo showing potholes  

3. AI Agents detect mismatch  

4. System generates:  
   **Risk Level: HIGH – Possible fund misuse**  

5. Location turns red on the map

## 🏛 Why It Matters  

Project INTEGRITY transforms citizens into **digital auditors**.  
It doesn’t accuse — it **verifies**.

By combining AI, maps, and public data, it creates:
- Accountability  
- Transparency  
- Trust  

This is how technology can strengthen democracy.
